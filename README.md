# PomoFlow App

PomoFlow is a Pomodoro Technique integrated productivity app that works on desktop & mobile browsers built with React, Express, MongoDB and graphQL.<br/>
I decided to use the MERN stack as I want to create an app with a database to store all the projects and tasks, which users can add, delete and update.<br/>
Also, I believe MERN can act the best in controlling and updating dynamic JSON data that can smoothly navigate between the front and backend.
